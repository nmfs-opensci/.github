### NMFS Open Science

The overarching vision of NMFS Open Science is to support scientific researchers within NOAA Fisheries in adopting of reproducible scientific workflows
and platforms, facilitate collaboration across offices and regions in shared scientific data science tasks, provide shared "best practices" resources, and support open science, open data and open source comminities and initiatives with NOAA Fisheries.

The NMFS Open Science GitHub org provides a shared GitHub resource to:

* Support organizational excellence by developing and sharing training resources available to all NOAA Fisheries offices.
* Support "user groups", such as R User Groups, within NOAA Fisheries by providing a calendar for posting events, providing discussion threads, and providing a cross-office location for sharing training materials.
* Collaborate on resources such as "best practices", "report writing templates", "package template" tailored to NOAA Fisheries applications.
* Helping science teams fulfil NOAA Open Science mandates: [NOAA Data Strategy for open and transparent data and analyses](https://sciencecouncil.noaa.gov/Portals/0/2020%20Data%20Strategy.pdf?ver=2020-09-17-150024-997), 
[Federal Data Strategy for accountability and transparency](https://strategy.data.gov/).
* Amplify as many open science leaders as possible, transforming their workflows to be more collaborative, efficient and reproducible.

NOAA Fisheries is partnering with [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to provide team-based training in reproducible workflows. See our [NMFS Openscapes page](https://openscapes.github.io/nmfs-openscapes/) for information on the program and upcoming Champions Cohorts. Openscapes’ long-term goal is to enable robust, inclusive, and enduring science- and data-driven solutions to global and time-sensitive challenges. We approach open science as a spectrum, as a behavior change, and as a movement. We see data analysis and stewardship as entryways to meet scientists where they are, helping them develop new skill sets and mindsets while empowering them as leaders.
